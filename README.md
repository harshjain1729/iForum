# iForum
An online Forum on which users can post their questions of some particular programming languages. Users can also answer questions asked by other users. On this platform, we have implemented Login and Logout functionality for users. A user can only ask or answer a question when he or she is logged into their own account. Our Engaging and responsive User Interface design has been created with Bootstrap.
